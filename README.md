# Sticky Fingers

## What is this?

This is a minecraft mod that introduces a magnet item. If you have this item in your inventory and it is activated, it will attract items up to 8 blocks away. Any items that spawn within an 8 block radius will end up in your inventory (if there is room, obviously). The same applies for items already on the floor coming in reach when walking around.

You can have more than one magnet in your inventory but only one will have effect.

## Activation

The magnet has 2 modes: active and inactive. When active, it will attract items (and when inactive, it won't). The magnet item will glint when it is active.
To toggle activation mode, you can press _M_ (configurable). All magnets in your inventory will toggle status at the same time.
